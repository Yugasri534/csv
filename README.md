What it built?
A sales data analysis tool that:

Generates a dummy sales dataset (Code 1).
Loads the sales data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and plots insights (Code 2).
Why it built?
The tool is built to:

Provide a sample sales dataset for testing or demonstration purposes.
Analyze sales data and gain insights into revenue by product and over time.
How it works?
Here's a high-level overview:

Data Generation: The first code generates a dummy sales dataset with columns for date, product, quantity, and price.
Data Loading: The second code loads the sales data from a CSV file.
Data Analysis: The code analyzes the sales data by:
Converting the date column to datetime format.
Calculating the total revenue by multiplying quantity and price.
Grouping the data by product and date, and calculating the total revenue for each group.
Plotting Insights: The code creates two plots:
A bar chart showing revenue by product.
A line plot showing revenue over time.
By combining these two codes, you can generate a sample sales dataset, analyze it, and gain insights into revenue by product and over time.
